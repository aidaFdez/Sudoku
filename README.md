# Sudoku
Making a sudoku generator for practise.

I used an array for the sudoku, but I think an implementation with a matrix couold have been easier.
I am also sure that there might be a better way to search for solutions, but a DFS was the first thing 
that came to my mind and I wanted to try some of the algorithms learnt at class.
